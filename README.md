# SCHERBELBERG

`scherbelberg` provides both a CLI interface and a library for deploying and managing small [Dask](https://dask.org/)-based HPC clusters in the [Hetzner cloud](http://cloud.hetzner.com/). Development status *alpha*, stability *acceptable*, security at this point *questionable* at best.

## Project's name

Next to impressive projects like [Fugaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugaku_(supercomputer)), which is named after [Mount Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji), the [TOP500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500) are clearly missing an entry from the city of [Leipzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig). This project is named after one of the few significant "mountains" in the city, the "Scherbelberg", also known as the "[Rosentalh√ºgel](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Rosentalh%C3%BCgel_(Leipzig))" (20 meters above the surrounding landscape and 125 meters above sea level). Staring out as a late 19th century landfill, it has since become part of a park-like landscape. As of 1975, a famously shaky steel [observation tower](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Rosentalturm) with a rather [beautiful view](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Views_from_Rosentalturm) is located at its top, overlooking not only the [Leipziger Auenwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig_Riverside_Forest) forest but also the city's sewage treatment plant.
