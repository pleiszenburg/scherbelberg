# SCHERBELBERG

The [TOP500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500) are clearly missing an entry from Leipzig. Named after one of the most significant mountains in the city, the "Scherbelberg", also known as the "[Rosentalh√ºgel](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Rosentalh%C3%BCgel_(Leipzig)?uselang=en)" (125 meters above sea level), this experimental project provides tools for deploying and managing small [Dask](https://dask.org/)-based HPC clusters in the Hetzner cloud.
