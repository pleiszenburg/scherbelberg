# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to *scherbelberg*!
**Contributions are highly welcomed!**

## Branching model

Development happens in the `develop` branch. Please issue pull requests against `develop`. The `master` branch is supposed to be kept at the latest, stable *release*.

## Language level & interpreters

This project is intended to work with Python 3.8 and later. The primary target so far is CPython, although PyPy support is highly welcome.

## General workflow

If you are planning on working on a "larger" issue or feature, please add yourself to the corresponding issue on GitHub or create a new one there - before you start working. This helps to reduce duplicate effort and allows to coordinate developers.

New features are supposed to be tested - if possible.
