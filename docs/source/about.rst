About ``scherbelberg``
======================

.. _synopsis:

Synopsis
--------

*scherbelberg* provides both a :ref:`CLI interface <cli>` and a :ref:`Python API <api>` for deploying and managing small `Dask`_-based HPC `clusters`_ in the `Hetzner cloud`_. Development status alpha, stability acceptable, :ref:`security <security>` also acceptable but implementation needs a review.

Project's Name
--------------

Next to impressive projects like `Fugaku`_, which is named after `Mount Fuji`_, the `TOP500`_ are clearly missing an entry from the city of `Leipzig`_. This project is named after one of the few significant "mountains" in the city, the "Scherbelberg", also known as the "`Rosentalhügel`_" (20 meters above the surrounding landscape and 125 meters above sea level). Starting out as a late 19th century landfill, it has since become part of a park-like landscape. As of 1975, a famously shaky steel `observation tower`_ with a rather `beautiful view`_ is located at its top, overlooking not only the `Leipziger Auenwald`_ forest but also the city's sewage treatment plant.
